                <h2>CertChamps</h2>
                <p>CertChamps is a huge project that me and 
                    my colleague Benjamin Long have been working 
                    on for the past 4 months.
                </p>
                <p>This is a competitive leaving cert focused mobile 
                    app that will aim to make practicing questions a 
                    more enjoyable experience for many students. Currently 
                    we have developed an infinite feed of flashcards that 
                    is very reminiscent of apps like TikTok aswell as the 
                    ability to save questions, add friends, and rank up. 
                    When you add a friend you are able to start challenges 
                    with them where a timer will start and you will both be 
                    dealt 3 flashcards. Whoever solves them the quickest will 
                    gain XP that will contribute to their rank. The questions 
                    in our feed are uniquely made and are not just questions 
                    taken from leaving cert papers.
                </p>
                <p>In the future we plan on implementing a social feed where 
                    you can post questions, ask for help, see when your 
                    friends have ranked up and collaborate on different topics. 
                    In addition to this we plan on making use of Ai to generate 
                    the questions in the TikTok style feed to make it truly infinite.
                </p>
                <p>Whether this project takes off and becomes a useful tool for 
                    students or not, I believe the experience that both of us 
                    have gained has been invaluable. We have learned how to build 
                    an app, manage databases and create websites all while maintaining 
                    a clean, coherent and polished design.
                </p>
                <p>This app is scheduled for release by September and we are very 
                    excited to share it! The pictures show just a peak at what we 
                    have so far but there is far more to show. More updates will 
                    come soon.
                </p>
