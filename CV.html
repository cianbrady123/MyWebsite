                    <li>
                        Laguages learned in college:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Matlab</li>

                    <li>
                        I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this website aswell as the website
                        for CertChamps.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have lots of experience with React Native in JavaScript for app development
                        having built the CertChamps app. We also used Python for the AI generated 
                        flashcard questions. In the backend we also used Firebase for database and 
                        authentication.

                    <li>
                        I have experience with C# in unity for casual game development. This is not to a
                        high degree and was purley for my own enjoyment.

                    <li>
                        I did the UNIX programming elective in college where I learned advanced C programming
                        and this lead me to install Linux on my laptop and use it as my main OS. This has
                        given me a lot of experience with the command line and shell scripting.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Hardware</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I took the Robotics Design Project module in college where I learned how to use
                        Arduino, C++ and Lego to build robots that competed in a 'RoboRugby' competition.'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I built an Arduino based synthesizer which thought me more about arduino and 
                        the basics of how analogue synthesis works. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Following this I ran a project as Robotics Officer in the UCD Engineering 
                        Society where I ran workshops teaching people about analogue synthesis while 
                        we worked on an anaolgue drum machine.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Software</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I learned how to use SOFA for simulating soft robotics while doing the research program
                        at CUHK while doing their summer research program.
